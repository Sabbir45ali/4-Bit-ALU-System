## Overview

An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a crucial component of a computer processor that performs arithmetic and logical operations on binary numbers. This project focuses on creating a simple 4-bit ALU that can execute various functions such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR operations.

## Features

- **Addition**: Perform binary addition of two 4-bit numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Perform binary subtraction of two 4-bit numbers.
- **Logical AND**: Execute bitwise AND operation on two 4-bit numbers.
- **Logical OR**: Execute bitwise OR operation on two 4-bit numbers.
- **Logical XOR**: Execute bitwise XOR operation on two 4-bit numbers.
- **Zero Flag**: Indicate if the result of an operation is zero.
- **Overflow Flag**: Indicate if there is an overflow in arithmetic operations.

## Technologies Used

- **VHDL**: Hardware description language used for FPGA and ASIC design.
- **Xilinx VIVADO**: Software tool for synthesis and simulation of VHDL code.
- **ModelSim**: Simulation tool for verifying the functionality of the VHDL code.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sabbir45ali/4-Bit-ALU-System.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash

    ```

3. Open the project in your preferred VHDL development environment (e.g., Xilinx ISE, ModelSim).

## Usage

1. **Simulation**:
    - Open the VHDL files in your simulation tool (e.g., ModelSim).
    - Compile the VHDL files to check for syntax errors.
    - Run the simulation to verify the functionality of the ALU.

2. **Synthesis**:
    - Open the VHDL files in your synthesis tool (e.g., Xilinx ISE).
    - Synthesize the design to generate a bitstream file.
    - Upload the bitstream file to an FPGA to test the ALU in hardware.
